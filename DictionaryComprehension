1.
Create a dictionary from the list with same key:value pairs, such as: {"key": "key"}.


lst=["NY", "FL", "CA", "VT"]

#Type your answer here.

dict={}



print(dict)


2.
First, create a range from 100 to 160 with steps of 10.

Second, using dict comprehension, create a dictionary where each number in the range is the key and each item divided by 100 is the value.



#Type your answer here.

rng=
dict={}


print(dict)



3.
Using dict comprehension and a conditional argument create a dictionary from the current dictionary where only the key:value pairs with value above 2000 are taken to the new dictionary.
#Type your answer here.
dict1={"NFLX":4950,"TREX":2400,"FIZZ":1800, "XPO":1700}
dict2={}


print(dict2)
